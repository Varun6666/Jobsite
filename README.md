# NLP Job Advertisement Classification Web Application
This project presents an end-to-end Natural Language Processing (NLP) system designed to classify job advertisements into industry categories through a Flask-based web application.
The application processes unstructured job advertisement text, applies preprocessing and feature engineering techniques, and generates classification predictions through an integrated machine learning pipeline.

## Project Description
The objective of this project is to demonstrate the deployment of a machine learning workflow within a web application environment. The system transforms raw textual data into structured numerical representations and performs automated classification based on learned patterns.
Users interact with the application through a web interface, where input text is processed in real time and categorized into predefined job domains.
